Let's assume we have a computer which is connected to [the Internet](http://imgur.com/1IPwDFd).
When we type [hackbulgaria.com](http://hackbulgaria.com) into a browser and press Enter, we actually ask for the website's address.
Our **ISP** (Internet Service Provider) checks nameservers to find where the website is stored.
**Websites** are files with code, images, etc., stored on **servers**.
**Nameservers** store the **IP** (Internet Protocol) and alias of the server with the website files.
The server processes our request and return the site in **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language).
Our browser reads the HTML and the optional **stylesheets** and **scripts** and displays them.
*Shiny!*
